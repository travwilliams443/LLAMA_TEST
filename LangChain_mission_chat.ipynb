      "1. **Infiltration:**\n",
      "   - Start by choosing your entry method into the walled base. You can:\n",
      "     - Open the **locked front gate**, which requires some effort or a skill check to unlock.\n",
      "     - Or infiltrate through the **guardhouse located at the southwestern corner** of the map. Utilize the elevated catwalks to gain entry without being detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Entering the Underground Facility:**\n",
      "   - Once inside the walled area, your next step is to find a route underground. There are two options:\n",
      "     - **Option A:** Head to the **northeast fenced area** and look for the **locked door** that leads underground (it has an 80% lock strength). You may need lockpicking tools or skills to open it.\n",
      "     - **Option B:** Go to the building that has a **repair bot** inside. The main door to this building is blocked, but you can enter through the **building immediately to the south**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Unlocking the Doors:**\n",
      "   - Once you’re underground, you will encounter several doors:\n",
      "     - Use the code **8456** to unlock the first door you come across.\n",
      "     - Use this code again to unlock a second door.\n",
      "     - When you reach the door labeled **\"launch command,\"** use the code a third time (note that the door labeled \"missile silo\" cannot be accessed yet).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Execute Abort Command:**\n",
      "   - After going through the launch command door, you’ll find a well-guarded area with **Men in Black and MJ12 commandos.**\n",
      "   - Proceed upstairs and **press the abort button.** \n",
      "   - Then, use the terminal on the left labeled **Elder/Armageddon** to initiate a new missile launch aimed at Area 51.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Check the Missile Launch Site:**\n",
      "   - After initiating the launch, your next objective is to check the missile launch site to ensure that MJ12 has not sabotaged it.\n",
      "   - Now that the missile silo door is accessible, proceed through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Navigating the Silo:**\n",
      "   - You can choose to either go through:\n",
      "     - The **long, narrow corridor** which is guarded by more enemies, or \n",
      "     - The **floor vent** leading to the bottom of the silo.\n",
      "   - No matter which route you choose, you’ll need to access the **elevator** inside the silo.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Inside the Elevator:**\n",
      "   - The elevator has **6 levels**. Notably, level 4 has a **repair bot**.\n",
      "   - Head to **level 2** where you will encounter **MJ12 agent Howard Strong.** You need to eliminate him to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Final Steps:**\n",
      "   - After defeating Howard Strong, take the elevator to **level 6**. \n",
      "   - Exit the silo **through the ladder.**\n",
      "   - At the top, activate the button to **open the surface hatch.**\n",
